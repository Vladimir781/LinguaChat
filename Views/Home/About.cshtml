    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead">The interactive web platform for learning English with the help of artificial intelligence was created by Didok Volodymyr as part of their bachelor's qualification work in KN CompN group 2019-1, specialty 122 Computer science.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Services Included</h2>
            <p>The platform is designed to provide a personalized and interactive learning experience to students. It includes three services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A chat for learning new words</li>
                <li>A chat for checking grammar</li>
                <li>A chat for practicing English with the simulation of an interlocutor</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Chat for Learning New Words</h2>
            <p>The chat for learning new words is designed to facilitate effective learning of new words. Students can ask for the topic of the lesson, and the artificial intelligence will suggest a list of basic words related to that topic. Users can also ask for the meaning of unfamiliar words, and the AI will provide definitions and usage examples. Additionally, students can ask questions related to the lesson topic and receive answers from the AI assistant.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Chat for Checking Grammar</h2>
            <p>The chat for checking grammar is designed to improve users' grammar skills. Users can submit their texts for checking, and the AI will analyze the text for grammar mistakes and provide recommendations for correcting them. Users can also request the rules applied to the corrected text and examples of using these rules in sentences. The AI can generate and send examples of using rules in sentences with explanations.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Chat for Practicing English with the Simulation of an Interlocutor</h2>
            <p>The chat for practicing English with the simulation of an interlocutor is designed to provide personalized and interactive learning. Users can send text messages to the AI, and it will check the text for grammar mistakes and provide suggestions for correcting them. Moreover, the AI can simulate a human interlocutor, responding to the student's message, taking into account the grammar and vocabulary they use.</p>
            <p>The web platform is developed using .NET MVC technology and uses the GPT-3.5 turbo model through an API to generate text according to the needs of specific services. GPT-3.5 is a powerful neural network text generator developed by OpenAI, and its functional capabilities allow for personalized and interactive learning, making language learning more accessible and enjoyable for students. Thanks to the integration of GPT-3.5, the platform can provide students with high-quality language learning services, helping them improve their English skills in an interesting and engaging way.</p>
